# @virtuality-is/gaia

**Self-organizing networks of living nodes**

Gaia is a lightweight library for building **adaptive, emergent networks** where each Sprite autonomously optimizes its connections, forming a **living, distributed system**.

---

## Features

- **Sprites (Autonomous Nodes):** Each Sprite independently maintains its state and connectivity.
- **Neighborhood Convergence:** Sprites continuously optimize connections with the most valuable peers.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Integrates reactive cues and repeating tasks for dynamic behavior.
- **Vibes (Connections):** Sprites communicate through subtle, living links.
- **Gaia (Global Hub):** Aggregates network information and orchestrates the system.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @virtuality-is/gaia
```

---

## Quick Start

```javascript

```

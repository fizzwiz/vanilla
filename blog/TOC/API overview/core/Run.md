# âš¡ Run Class â€” `@fizzwiz/pattern/core`

The `Run` class is a foundational abstraction in the `@fizzwiz/pattern` library.  
It represents a **focused, locally executable process** â€” the simplest form of algorithmic logic grounded in a single idea.

Every `Run` is a concrete unit of computation designed to solve a category of problems.

---

## ðŸ§  Concept

- **Run** models a computational act.
- It executes an algorithmic idea that can either:
  - Return a solution directly
  - Or mutate its internal state for further interrogation.

This abstraction provides a **unified interface (`run()`)** for executing a unit of logic.

The utility of this class is to distinguish conventional algorithms (the `Run`) from other types of processes, such as:
- Formal definitions of solutions (`Search`)
- Event-driven asynchronous programs (`Asynclet`)
- Distributed computations (`WispCall`)

## ðŸ§¾ API Reference

### `run(): Run | any`

Runs the algorithm defined by the subclass.

- **Returns**:  
  A value (e.g. a result), or a reference to `this` for fluent method chaining.

- **Throws**:  
  An error if not implemented in the subclass.

---

### `what(): Run | any`

Delegates to `run()`.  
This method is inherited from the `What` interface and allows unified querying behavior across abstractions.

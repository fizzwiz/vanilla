# 🏠 Introduction to `@fizzwiz/sorted`

This library introduces **Sorted Collections** and a powerful **representation-based** approach to equivalence among collected objects.

## 📌 A Familiar Problem

The importance of sorted collections is often underestimated. JavaScript, for example, doesn’t provide them out of the box.  
Yet sorting objects is key — both in advanced problem solving and everyday computations.

## 🎯 The Search-and-Select Pattern

Sorting candidate solutions naturally leads to a unifying concept we call the **Search-and-Select Pattern** — a powerful strategy for solving a wide range of **optimization problems**.

In this pattern:

- A **search space** is modeled by the `What` class.
- A **search** is expressed as an iteration via the `Each` class.  
  (Both `Each` and `What` come from the companion library [`@fizzwiz/fluent`](https://fluent-js.blogspot.com))
- A **priority queue** manages the order of exploration.

We’ll explore this pattern more deeply in future articles — see, for instance:

## 🧠 A Library That Matches Your Thinking

While designed with powerful patterns in mind, `Queue`s in this library are useful even outside of that context.  
They offer a **fluent, natural syntax** for expressing complex logic with:

- Well-defined queues  
- Custom equivalence among objects

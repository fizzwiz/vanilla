# ðŸ§± v0.0.0-dev.1 â€” First Brick

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the **first prerelease** of `@fizzwiz/pattern`: **v0.0.0-dev.1** â€” the *First Brick* laying the foundation for a library dedicated to **making the impossible possible**.

This release unveils the core abstractions: `Run`, `Search`, `Chore`, and `RoamingCall`.  
Each abstraction serves as the cornerstone for its own package, offering expressive, high-level problem-solving patterns.

Notably, the `Search` class brings full support for the [search-and-select pattern](https://blog.fizzwiz.cloud/2025/06/search-and-select-pattern.html), enabling formal and symbolic exploration of infinite solution spaces. The other abstractions will benefit from specialized classes poised to unlock their full power.

> ðŸ§ª This is a **prerelease**, ready for exploration. Your early feedback is invaluable and will help shape the APIâ€™s evolution and future features.

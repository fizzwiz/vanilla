# ðŸ§± v0.0.0-dev.1 â€” First Brick

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the **first prerelease** of `@fizzwiz/vanilla`: **v0.0.0-dev.1** â€” the *First Brick* laying the foundation for a library dedicated to **providing lightweight semantics for working with plain JSON objects**.

This release unveils the core abstractions: `OptionStore` and `ObjNavigator`.

* **OptionStore:** Store and retrieve options by type, with automatic lookup along an instanceâ€™s prototype chain.
* **ObjNavigator:** Navigate and manipulate nested objects safely and intuitively, supporting scoped navigation with `with()` and returning to the parent with `without()`.

> ðŸ§ª This is a **prerelease**, intended for exploration and feedback. Your early experiences and suggestions will help shape the API and future features.

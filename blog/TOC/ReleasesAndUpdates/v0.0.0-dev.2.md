# 🍦 v0.0.0-dev.2 — Sweet Refinements

We’re excited to release **v0.0.0-dev.2** of `@fizzwiz/vanilla`, continuing to polish the foundation laid by the *First Brick* (v0.0.0-dev.1).

This update focuses on **cleaning up inconsistencies and making the API smoother**:

* **Documentation & typos:** Fixed minor inconsistencies between the code and the docs, ensuring clarity and correctness.
* **New alias:** The method `within()` now also responds to the shorter, more intuitive alias `with()`, making scoped navigation even cleaner.

> 🧪 As with previous prereleases, this version is meant for exploration and feedback. Your suggestions help shape the library’s future features and usability.

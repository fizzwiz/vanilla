# 🍦 v0.0.0-dev.3 — Navigating with Style

We’re thrilled to release **v0.0.0-dev.3** of `@fizzwiz/vanilla`, building on the foundations from previous prereleases.

This version introduces **declarative exploration and enhanced object navigation**:

* **Search integration:** `ObjNavigator` now includes a `search()` method powered by `@fizzwiz/prism`, enabling **fluent, declarative traversal** of nested objects.
* **New utilities:** `delete()` and `select()` provide convenient ways to remove or filter nested entries.

> 🧪 As with prior prereleases, this version is experimental and intended for exploration and feedback. Your input is invaluable in shaping the library’s future direction.

**Next steps:** Try out `search()` for declarative object exploration and test the new `delete()` and `select()` helpers. Let us know your experiences! 👉 [🍦](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fizzwiz/vanilla)

# 🍦 v0.0.0-dev.4 — Step into Depth

We’re excited to release **v0.0.0-dev.4** of `@fizzwiz/vanilla`, continuing to refine object navigation and introspection.

This version adds **path-aware navigation**:

* **Step property:** Each `ObjNavigator` now tracks the `step` used to reach it from its parent, providing context for hierarchical operations.
* **Path method:** `path(byProperty = false)` returns the full path from the top-level ancestor. Choose **logical depth** (per navigator step) or **structural depth** (per property segment) using the boolean flag.
* **Enhanced depth introspection:** Easily compute both the navigator’s logical and structural depth in nested objects.

> 🧪 As with previous prereleases, this version is experimental. Feedback helps shape the API and ensures semantic clarity.

**Next steps:** Experiment with `step` and `path()` for fine-grained navigation, depth analysis, and hierarchical reasoning in your JSON data. Share your experiences and ideas! 👉 [🍦](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fizzwiz/vanilla)

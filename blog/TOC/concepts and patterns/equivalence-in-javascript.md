# üß† Equivalence in JavaScript: Contemplating a True Set

In JavaScript, **equivalence** behaves differently depending on whether you're working with primitive or non-primitive types.

For **primitives**‚Äîsuch as numbers, booleans, strings, and symbols‚Äîequivalence is determined by comparing actual values. If two variables hold the same value, they are considered equivalent.

However, for **objects and arrays**, equivalence is **by reference**. Two arrays `[0]` and `[0]` are not considered equal because they are separate instances, even though they contain identical content.

---

## üî¨ Snippet 1: Equivalence by Value and by Reference

```js
new Set([0, 0]);       // => Set { 0 }
new Set([[0], [0]]);   // => Set { [0], [0] }
```

JavaScript‚Äôs `Set` treats the two `0` values as equivalent but considers `[0]` and `[0]` as distinct because they are different object instances.

This reveals JavaScript‚Äôs minimalist view of equivalence: only primitives benefit from value-based equivalence.

But that's not the full story.

---

## üß© Contemplating a True Set

> Even if Set implemented value-based equivalence for arrays or objects by deeply inspecting all their properties, it still wouldn‚Äôt capture the true essence of a Set.

Equivalence can go beyond mere value: it can be based on **length**, **structure**, **content**, or other contextually relevant attributes.

A "true set" should support any meaningful notion of equivalence.

---

## üî† Snippet 2: Equivalence by Length

```js
import { TrueSet } from "@fizzwiz/sorted";

const byLength = new TrueSet(equivalenceByLength);
byLength.add("what");
byLength.add("that");   // Considered duplicate: same length as "what"
```

In this example, `"that"` is considered equivalent to `"what"` because both have length 4.

But how is this equivalence logic passed to the set?

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Defining Equivalence

Let‚Äôs explore three ways to define equivalence in code:

### ‚ùå Boolean Equality Function

A general approach is to define a boolean function:

```js
function equals(a, b) { return ...; }
```

However, this requires comparing each item with every other‚Äîinefficient for large collections.

This approach is often paired with:

```js
function hashCode(x) { return ...; }
```

The `hashCode()` function narrows comparisons by assigning each item to an integer that **represents an equivalence class** larger than the intended equivalence `equals(a, b)`. Such broader equivalence is often further enlarged by the modulo operation `hashCode(x) % n`. While this method is efficient, it‚Äôs conceptually disputable. Why not define the **intended equivalence directly**, using its natural representation function?

---

### ‚úÖ Representation Function

A clean and conceptually elegant solution uses a `repr(item)` function directly to map an item to a **representative** of its equivalence class.

```js
function repr(word) {
  return word.length;
}
```

Here, words of the same length are considered equivalent.

However, we still need to define how to compare two representations.

---

### ‚úÖ Comparator Function

A numeric `compare(a, b)` function defines equivalence by returning `0` for equivalent values:

```js
function compare(a, b) {
  return a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : 0;
}
```

This enables efficient `O(log n)` comparisons, removing the need for auxiliary hashing. Comparators are composable, making them powerful for sorting and equivalence alike.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Multivariate Representation

Since the value returned by the representation function is not relevant as long as it is the same for all equivalent items, we can assume ‚Äî without loss of generality ‚Äî the representation function returns **arrays** of values. This makes it ideal for expressing **compound equivalences**.

---

## üì¶ Snippet 3: Equivalence by Length and First Character

```js
import { TrueSet } from "@fizzwiz/sorted";

const repr = item => [item.length, item[0]];
const byLengthAndFirstCharacter = new TrueSet(repr);
byLengthAndFirstCharacter.add("what");
byLengthAndFirstCharacter.add("that");   // -> true
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è TrueSet as a Sorted Collection of Arrays

From this perspective, a `TrueSet` appears to be a collection of arrays in the form:

```js
[...repr(item), item]
```

The constructor accepts:

- A `repr` function
- A series of `comparator` functions for sorting and deduplication.

The last comparator determines whether two items with the **same representation** are allowed to coexist.

---

## üì¶ Snippet 4: A Common Set (No Duplicates)

```js
import { TrueSet, ORDER } from "@fizzwiz/sorted";
const repr = item => item.length;

const byLength = new TrueSet(repr, ORDER.ASCENDING, ORDER.SINGULAR);
byLength.add("what");
byLength.add("that");   // -> false
```

Here, equivalent items are **not** stored twice.

---

## üì¶ Snippet 5: A Rich Set (Multiple Equivalent Items)

```js
import { TrueSet } from "@fizzwiz/sorted";

const repr = item => item.length;
const byLength = new TrueSet(repr); // Uses ASCENDING_ORDER by default
byLength.add("what");
byLength.add("that");   // -> true
```

Here, equivalent items **can** coexist and be enumerated.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Classifier: A Generalization of TrueSet

Therefore, the `TrueSet` is a specialized case of a more general data structure: the **Classifier**. The Classifier stores **arrays of items** ‚Äî supporting arrays of varying lengths ‚Äî and enables enumeration of classes based on specified keys.

```js
import { Classifier } from "@fizzwiz/sorted";

const classifier = new Classifier();
classifier.add([4]);
classifier.add([4, "w", "what"]);
classifier.add([4, "t", "that"]);
classifier.add([4, "w", "who"]);

classifier.class(4);                      // -> [[4], [4, "w", "what"], [4, "t", "that"], [4, "w", "who"]]
classifier.class(undefined, "w");         // -> [[4, "w", "what"], [4, "w", "who"]]
```

---

## üßµ Consequences of This Approach

- üí° Representation-based equivalence reduces to simple comparators.
- ‚ú® Collections are **intrinsically sorted**.
- ‚úÖ Any array is storable as long as a comparator exists for its components.

---

## üß≠ What‚Äôs Next

In future posts, we‚Äôll explore the internal mechanics of `TrueSet` and `Classifier`, as well as advanced applications like multi-valued maps.

But remember: at its core, this system is simple:

> Every collection is a **Sorted Collection of Arrays**, a **Classifier**, powered by a **representation function**.

# ðŸ§¬ Core Package â€” `@fizzwiz/pattern/core`

The `core` module defines foundational abstractions that enable building high-level problem-solving structures within the `@fizzwiz/pattern` library.

These abstractions extend computation beyond traditional control flowsâ€”supporting infinite search spaces, event-driven behaviors, and distributed computations.

## ðŸ”¹ Overview

### Classes

- [âš¡ Run](https://pattern-js.blogspot.com/p/run-class.html)  
  A concrete, locally executable solution for a well-defined class of problemsâ€”a focused burst of logic.

- [ðŸ§  Search](https://pattern-js.blogspot.com/p/search-class.html)  
  A formal, symbolic representation of an infinite journey through a space of candidate solutions.

- [ðŸ§¹ Chore](https://pattern-js.blogspot.com/p/chore-class.html)  
  An event-sensitive, reactive agent that *feels* and *acts* within its environment.

- [ðŸ“£ RoamingCall](https://pattern-js.blogspot.com/p/roamingcall-class.html)  
  A distributed invocation transcending local executionâ€”roaming, intangible, and boundaryless.

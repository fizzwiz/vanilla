/**
 * ðŸŒŒ Aura
 * --------
 * Abstract base class for discovering and attaching `Vibe` connections to a `Sprite`.
 *
 * In Gaiaâ€™s distributed ecosystem, an **Aura** represents a *field of discovery*
 * that surrounds a `Sprite`. It defines how the Sprite perceives and establishes
 * new connections (`Vibes`) within its environment.
 *
 * Subclasses implement specific discovery mechanisms:
 * - `GaiaAura` â€” Periodically queries the Gaia network for nearby Sprites.
 * - `HttpAura` â€” Listens for incoming WebSocket or HTTP requests to form new Vibes.
 *
 * An Aura does not *own* its Sprite; rather, it *enriches* it by managing its
 * connectivity field. It can operate independently, even without being added
 * to `sprite.auras`.

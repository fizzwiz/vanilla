/**
 * ðŸŒŒ **Aura**
 * ------------
 * Abstract base class for discovering and attaching `Vibe` connections to a `Sprite`.
 *
 * In Gaiaâ€™s distributed ecosystem, an **Aura** represents a *field of discovery*
 * that surrounds a `Sprite`. It defines how the Sprite perceives and establishes
 * new connections (`Vibes`) within its environment.
 *
 * ---
 * ðŸ§© **Subclassing**
 * - `GaiaAura` â€” Periodically queries the Gaia network for nearby Sprites.
 * - `HttpAura` â€” Listens for incoming WebSocket or HTTP requests to form new Vibes.
 *
 * ---
 * ðŸ’« **Attachment Model**
 * Auras are not bound to a Sprite at construction time.  
 * Instead, they are explicitly attached by adding them to the Spriteâ€™s `auras` ensemble:
 *
 * ```js
 * const aura = new GaiaAura();
 * sprite.auras.add("gaia", aura);
 * console.log(aura.sprite === sprite); // true
 * ```
 *
 * ---
